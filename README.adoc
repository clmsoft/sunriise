This project is an import (fork) of the
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sunriise/[Sunriise]
project at SourceForge.

Per the description on the
http://sunriise.sourceforge.net/[sunriise overview page]:

*sunriise* goal is to provide read/write support for Microsoft Money *.mny file.

For specifics of how I pulled and updated this project
to run with a more recent toolset, see
xref:sunriise_import.adoc[sunriise_import.adoc].
